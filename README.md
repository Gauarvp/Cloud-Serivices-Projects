Cloud Cognitive Services Projects
This repository contains projects focused on leveraging cloud cognitive services to enhance language translation, image recognition, and sentiment analysis capabilities. The projects utilize cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud to access and integrate various cognitive services APIs.

Project 1: Translator Service
Solution:
To use the Translator Service, follow the steps below:

Obtain Cloud Cognitive Services API Key: Sign up for an account on the chosen cloud platform (Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud) and generate an API key for the Translator service.

Configure API Key: Replace the YOUR_TRANSLATOR_API_KEY placeholder in the code files with the actual API key obtained in the previous step.

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary libraries or SDKs required for the chosen cloud platform. Refer to the cloud provider's documentation for installation instructions.

Run the Project: Execute the project files and provide the required inputs such as text or language pairs for translation. Follow the code comments and documentation within the project for more specific usage instructions.

Project 2: Vision/NLP
Solution:
To use the Vision/NLP project, follow the steps below:

Obtain Cloud Cognitive Services API Key: Sign up for an account on the chosen cloud platform (Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud) and generate an API key for the Vision and NLP services.

Configure API Key: Replace the YOUR_VISION_API_KEY and YOUR_NLP_API_KEY placeholders in the code files with the actual API keys obtained in the previous step.

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary libraries or SDKs required for the chosen cloud platform. Refer to the cloud provider's documentation for installation instructions.

Run the Project: Execute the project files and provide the required inputs such as image files or text strings. Follow the code comments and documentation within the project for more specific usage instructions.
